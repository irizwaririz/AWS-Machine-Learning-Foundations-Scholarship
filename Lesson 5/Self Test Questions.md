## Test your knowledge with the following questions about Lesson 5: Software engineering practices, Part 2

NOTES: 

**The questions might provide clues to the previous questions so skipping questions might ruin the experience.**

**Since this lesson is about software engineering practices, it is best to practice these concepts on actual code as well. This is because the quiz will surely ask questions about specific coding scenarios that won't be covered by the questions below:**

* Why do we create tests for our code?

      Because some problems/errors in code aren't easily detectable. And sometimes we create unintentional mistakes due to human error. Our tests help catch those errors.

* This is an emerging software development process in which software requirements are first converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and all software development are tracked by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
