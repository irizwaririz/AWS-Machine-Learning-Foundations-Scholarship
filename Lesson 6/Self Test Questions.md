## Test your knowledge with the following questions about Lesson 6: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

NOTES: 

**The questions might provide clues to the previous questions so skipping questions might ruin the experience.**

**Since this lesson is about object-oriented programming in Python, identification type questions are not that suitable for some concepts. It is better to test yourself with situational questions (different scenarios) instead which you can find in the internet. The quiz will surely ask questions about specific coding scenarios that won't be covered by the questions below:**

* In your own words, describe the difference between objects and classes.

      An easy analogy is:

      Objects are things that exist in the real world.

      Classes are the blueprints of things that exist in the real world.

      Therefore objects are the "manifestation" of classes. And classes dictate what those "manifestations" will look like.

* What are the two essential parts of an object/class and describe both of them in your own words.
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>

      The two essential parts are (1) Attributes and (2) Methods:

      Attributes describe the characteristics of a certain object/class. This is why the best practice is to use nouns for them.

      Methods relay the available actions a certain object/class can do. This is basically a function inside a object/class. This is why the best practice is to use verbs for them.

    </details>

* Why is it frowned upon in other programming languages (C++, Java) to access/change attributes directly?
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>

      Because it offers less stability. When requirements change, this may lead to changing a lot of parts of the code and a lot of scenarios where you're repeating yourself (making the same changes across multiple lines/files)

    </details>

* Why is the OOP concept - Inheritance - called that way? And why do we use it?
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>

      It is called Inheritance because the "children" classes inherit the attributes and methods of their "parent" classes.

      We implement Inheritance because it helps us with writing modular code. It helps you to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
